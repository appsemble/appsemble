A block that displays a map powered by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) that can
be used to display and interact with markers.

Markers can be loaded from external sources or from Appsembleâ€™s resource API.

Markers that are too close to each other to be visually distinguishable will be clustered by
default.
