A block used for accessing OpenAI's models through their API.

In order to use this block, you need to have an API key from OpenAI. You can get one by signing up
at their [website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and follow this
[article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key). Then you
need to add it to the app's configuration by going to `Secrets > Service > Add new secret`
(https://appsemble.app/en/apps/{appId}/secrets), or add it in the `secrets.json` file in the app
folder and export it as an environment variable, following this
[documentation](https://appsemble.app/en/docs/02-guides/App#secrets).
