## Block classes

Everyone can create their own blocks, with any technology. Stricter requirements are enforced on
core blocks. These are the 3 classes of blocks:

| block class | requirements                            | SLA covered | Location                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| core        | mandatory: plain JS / Preact / mini-jsx | yes         | https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble/-/tree/main/blocks |
| custom      | suggested: plain js / Preact / mini-jsx | optionally  | https://gitlab.com/appsemble/apps                         |
