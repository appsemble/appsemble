A block that can be used to display larger sets of data.

### Context fields

The [context](https://appsemble.app/docs/remappers/data#context) of this block will contain: `index`
for the index of the rows in the table as a whole, as well as `repeatedIndex` for any repeated row
within the table. This is `0` by default.
