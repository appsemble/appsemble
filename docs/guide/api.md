# API

The Appsemble API is defined using OpenAPI 3. The SwaggerUI API explorer can be found
[here](/api-explorer).

**Note**: Appsemble is still under active development. API calls may change in breaking ways.

## Authorization

For third party clients, Appsemble uses the OAuth2 client credentials grant type. For example the
official [Appsemble CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appsemble/cli) client credentials to
authenticate.

Appsemble client credentials can be registered under
[client credentials](/settings/client-credentials) in user settings. Registering client users will
output the client id and client secret as `client_id:client_secret`.

The client credentials may be used to request an access token. They need to be encoded joined using
a colon (`:`) and encoded as base64.

For example, in NodeJS the client credentials can be encoded as base64 as follows:

```js copy
const [clientId, clientSecret] = clientCredentials.split(':');
const encoded = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString('base64');
```

An example request:

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Basic {encoded}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&scope={my_scope}
```

This will return the following response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "your.access.token",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

The access token in the response can be used as a bearer HTTP header to authorize the request. For
example to query the resources of an app:

```http
POST /api/apps HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your.access.token
