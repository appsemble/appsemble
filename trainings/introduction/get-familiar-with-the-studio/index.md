# Get familiar with the studio

The Appsemble studio is the optimal way to interact with the framework. It acts as a central hub for
all the important Appsemble features like app building, managing your account and managing your
organization(s).

First, you should understand how to set up your account so you can access all Appsemble features:

- [Account setup](/docs/studio/account-setup)

Once your account has been set up you can explore all features Appsemble has to offer. In order to
get a good understanding of the different sections in the studio, you should check out the following
docs:

- [App store](/docs/studio/app-store)
- [Block store](/docs/studio/block-store)

**(Optional)** If you intend to use Appsemble with a group of people, it's good to understand how
organizations work as well:

- [Organizations](/docs/studio/organizations)

You should now have a good understanding of how the Appsemble studio works and where to go if you
are ever stuck on something.
