# Bulma theming

An easy way to customise your app is by changing the colors of specific variables. These variables
are tied to certain parts of the app and blocks. Elements like the header, buttons and backgrounds
all get their color from the app's `primaryColor` variable.

Setting this variable to a different color changes the colors of all these elements. This is called
**theming**.

To get a good understanding on how theming works, be sure to read the following article:
