# Custom CSS

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) is a technology that's been used to style websites for
decades. It has been integrated into Appsemble allowing you to have full control over what your app
will look like. While you get a lot of extra options the learning curve is higher compared to
theming.

If you're not familiar with using CSS we recommend first learning the basics before applying your
knowledge in Appsemble. One of the most common ways to learn this is through W3Schools.

The following tutorials should give you a good base to start with. It's recommended you pratice a
bit locally before trying out with Appsemble, since some of our selectors might be difficult to
reach from time to time.

Once you know the basics of how styling a webpage works, you can look into how this works on
Appsemble.
