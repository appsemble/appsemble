# Styling options

There are two options for styling your Appsemble apps:

- **Theming**: Setting colors of pre-defined variables
- **Custom CSS**: Specific component styling

To get a general understand on how these styling options work, you should read the following
documentation article:

- [Styling](/docs/app/styling)

Just changing the colors of your app using theming variables can already help greatly in setting
your app apart from others. CSS however gives you full control over how your app will look like.
