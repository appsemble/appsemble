# App structure

At the root of Appsemble lies the app. An app is a collection of different systems that work
together to become whatever you want to make.

You do not need to know **how** all the different systems work right now, though it is important
that you know **which** ones there are.

The general overview of how an Appsemble app is structured can be found here:

- [App documentation](/docs/app#app)

The most important parts of an app are `pages` and `blocks`. These will be explained in the next
training module.
