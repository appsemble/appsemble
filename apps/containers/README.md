This app demonstrates how to use the companion containers feature, enabling the connection to custom
backend functionality. In this example a simple image is used, which only returns a status code.

When an app is cloned or published, the container is automatically created. When the 'Send request'
button is clicked, a request is sent to that container. If the request succeeds, it should return a
success message.

The container used can accept any HTTP method and returns the corrseponding success status.
