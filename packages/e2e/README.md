## Usage

To run end to end tests, run:

```sh
npm run e2e
```

The tests use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

After each test a video will be saved in the `packages/e2e/test-results/{name-test}` directory for
further inspection.

The end to end tests use the following environment variables:

- `BOT_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` — The email address used to login.
- `BOT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` — The password used to login.
- `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID` — By default tests are run against the staging environment on
  <https://staging.appsemble.review>. If this variable is specified, tests are run against the merge
  request review environment instead.
