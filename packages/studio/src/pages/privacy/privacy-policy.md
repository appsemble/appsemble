## What personal information we collect and why we collect it

### User Profiles

When creating a user profile in Appsemble, we require the user to enter an email address. Multiple
email addresses may be linked to the user account later. Each email address entered may be used in
combination with a password to login to your Appsemble account. One email address is marked as a
primary email address. The primary email address is used for sending email and to define a user
profile.

A user profile consists of a display name and the primary email address. The display name is
optional. User profiles are public to any organizations the user is a member of. Also apps built
using Appsemble may request user information if they require a login. The login process requires
explicit consent from the user upon login.

### Login with GitHub, Google, and other login providers

Appsemble offers users the ability to link their account to various third party login providers,
such as Google and GitHub. Appsemble uses this to allow the user to provide a single sign-on
experience. If a user chooses to link one of these services to their account, Appsemble will use the
user’s name and email address to complete their Appsemble profile. The user is free to change this
information afterwards.

## With whom we share your data

### Appsemble apps

Apps built with Appsemble may request user profile information the user has shared with Appsemble.
Appsemble will share this information only if the user explicitly contents to this in the login
process.

### Gravatar

Appsemble uses [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) by Automattic to get a user profile picture. To do
so, Appsemble must share an MD5 hash of the user’s primary email address with Gravatar. MD5 hashes
can’t be decrypted, meaning the email address isn’t directly shared with Gravatar.

### Error tracking & user feedback

Appsemble uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to track errors and user feedback. Anonymized user
information is sent to Sentry in case of an unexpected error. The user may send feedback. If they do
so, the name and email address entered in the feedback form, will be shared with Sentry.
