# Studio

The Appsemble studio is the website you can use to easily access the most important features of the
framework. The studio acts as a central site where all content like apps and blocks are uploaded to,
and where you can create your own apps using the app editor. You can also manage your organization
and learn more about the framework by looking at the documentation or following the trainings.

The official Appsemble studio can be found at https://appsemble.app, which is connected to the
Appsemble database and infrastructure. If you are hosting an Appsemble instance yourself, your
studio will be connected to your own infrastructure.

The studio consists of 5 pages:

- **[App store](/apps)**\
  Store page where you can see all publicly available apps, or the ones you have access to.

- **[Block store](/blocks)**\
  Store page where you can see all publicly available blocks, or the ones you have access to.

- **[Organizations](/organizations)**\
  List of all organizations that are registered on the website.

- **[Documentation](/docs)**\
  In depth explanations of Appsemble concepts.

- **[Trainings](/trainings)**\
  Training modules that guide you through understanding certain Appsemble concepts.
