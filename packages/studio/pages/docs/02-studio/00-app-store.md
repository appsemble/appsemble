# App store

The app store is a webpage where all apps you can access are shown. The page is divided into two
categories:

**My Apps** > All apps from organizations you're in\
**All Apps** > All apps that are publically available

Each app shows an icon, a title, which organization made it and what rating it has. Apps are
automatically sorted based on how their rating is, but you can change how this is sorted if you'd
like.

By clicking on any of these apps you're taken to their frontpage. Depending on the app's
[privacy setting](/docs/guides/security#app-privacy) and your role in the organization, you'll see a
different screen.

You can also create a new app on this page by clicking the [Create new App](/apps#create) button, or
you can import an app by clicking the arrow and then the [Import From File](/apps#import) button.

### App page

By default, you will only see the name, description, organization, screenshots, ratings and the
buttons to view or share the app. Different tabs and buttons are added depending on your
organization role and certain options the app owner can toggle.

#### Show app definition

If the app has the option to show the app definition, an extra tab appears in the side menu that
shows the entire app definition. A button also shows up on the index page that allows you to clone
the app for your own use.

#### Organization roles

Depending on your role in the app's organization you will see different pages and buttons.

- **Member (for all roles)**: Shows the App definition page, button to clone an app and the option
  to export the app
- **Translator**: Shows the Translation page
- **API Reader**: Shows the Assets page
- **API User**: Shows the Assets page, and allows you to create new assets
- **AppEditor (and up)**: Shows the Editor, Assets, Resources, Translations, Notifications,
  Snapshots, Settings, Variables, Secrets and Quotas pages.
- **Owner & Maintainer**: Shows button to add screenshots
