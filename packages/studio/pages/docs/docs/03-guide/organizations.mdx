# Organizations

An organization represents a collective name for groups of apps, blocks and users. In order to
publish new blocks or to create and manage apps, the user needs to be in an organization.

## Creating an organization

Organizations can be freely made in the Appsemble studio by visiting the settings page and clicking
on “Organizations” in the menu. From here you can view a list of organizations that you are already
part of, as well as create new organizations. When creating a new organization note that the
organization ID **must** be unique and cannot be changed after it has been created. This ID is used
to determine which blocks are used in an app, as well as where the app should be hosted by default.

## Deleting an organization

Organizations can be deleted by visiting the settings page of the respective organization and
clicking on the “Edit Organization” button. Only the owner of the organization is allowed to delete
the organization. In addition to that, the organization shouldn’t have any published blocks for it
to be deleted. Clicking on the `delete` button will open a popup for confirmation, following the
respective steps will allow you to delete the organization.

## Organization members

After creating an organization, members can be added via email. This email will contain a link that
the recipient can click on in order to accept or decline joining the organization.

Organization members can be assigned roles that affect which parts of the studio they have access
to. Each role has all the permissions of the previous role in the list.

These roles are the following:

- `Member`: The default role for new members. Organization members are able to view private apps
  that belong to the organization.
- `Translator`: Translators can view apps and other members are allowed to edit app messages.
- `API Reader`: A role that has permissions to view the app’s resources and assets. Particularly
  useful if the user wants to use the app’s API.
- `API User`: Similar to `API Reader`, but with additional write permissions for the app’s resources
  and assets.
- `AppEditor`: App editors are allowed to edit existing apps, manage an app’s resources, provide
  translations, as well as sending manual push notifications.
- `Maintainer`: Maintainers can publish new blocks, create new apps, change an app’s settings,
  create and delete apps, as well as invite other users to the organization.
- `Owner`: Owners are allowed to manage members by assigning roles or removing them from the
  organization, as well as update the name and icon of the organization.
- `AccountManager`: Account managers are allowed to read, create, edit and delete App accounts.
