# Group

## Introduction

Group actions allow app members with sufficient permissions to manage groups and invite and manage
group members. To know more about the groups visit [this page](../02-guides/groups.md). Group

Supported group actions are as follow.

- [`group.query`](#groupquery)
- [`group.member.invite`](#groupmemberinvite)
- [`group.member.query`](#groupmemberquery)
- [`group.member.delete`](#groupmemberdelete)
- [`group.member.role.update`](#groupmemberroleupdate)
