# User

## Introduction

User actions allow you to manage users for your app. User actions are client side actions i.e. these
actions are not implemented for the server side. Supported User actions are as below.

- [`user.register`](#userregister)
- [`user.login`](#userlogin)
- [`user.update`](#userupdate)
- [`user.logout`](#userlogout)
- [`user.query`](#userquery)
- [`user.remove`](#userremove)
- [`user.create`](#usercreate)

To use User actions, you must have a security definition in your app:

```yaml validate security-snippet
security:
  default:
    role: User
    policy: everyone
  roles:
    User: {}
```

### user.register<Side name="user.register" />

This action allows the user to register a new account using an email address and a password and does
nothing if the user is already logged in. Supported fields for this action are `type`, `email`,
`password`, `displayName`, `properties`, `login` and `picture`. Email and password are used for
logging in, `displayName` is the full name of user, login is a boolean value representing whether to
login the user after register (default value is true), picture is the profile picture of the user
and properties is used to denote any custom properties associated with user. All the values for
properties are converted into strings. Here is an example of this action in use.

Role defaults to the default role in the security definition. Accounts created via this action are
created on Appsemble as well i.e. the credentials(email and password) can be used to log in into the
Appsemble and access other apps. Similar to `user.remove` usage of this action requires
