# Link

## Introduction

Link actions can be used to redirect users to other pages or absolute URLs. These are client side
actions, i.e. these actions are not implemented for the server side. They are particularly useful
for navigation or redirecting. Supported link actions are the following.

- [`link`](/docs/reference/action#link)
- [`link.back`](/docs/reference/action#link.back)
- [`link.next`](/docs/reference/action#link.next)

### link<Side name="link" />

This action is used to redirect the user to other pages or absolute URLs. Supported fields for this
action are `type` and `to`. To is the name of the page to link to. Sub-pages can be referred to
using arrays. If this matches with an absolute URL, link action will open this instead of matching
it with a page or sub-page. Both fields are required. Here is how you can use this action in your
app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: 0.29.2
    parameters:
      icon: circle-chevron-right
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: link
        to: Page 2
```

### link.back<Side name="link.back" />

This action is used to link to the previous page in the browser history. Supported field for this
action is `type`, which is `link.back` in this case. The following is an example of this action
being used in an app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: control-buttons
    version: 0.29.2
    parameters:
      back: { icon: chevron-left }
      forward: false
    actions:
      onBack:
        type: link.back
```

### link.next<Side name="link.next" />

This action is used to link to the next page in the browser history. Supported field for this action
is `type`, which is `link.next` in this case. The following is an example of this action being used
in an app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: control-buttons
    version: 0.29.2
    parameters:
      back: { icon: chevron-left }
      forward: { icon: chevron-right }
    actions:
      onBack:
        type: link.back
      onForward:
        type: link.next
```
