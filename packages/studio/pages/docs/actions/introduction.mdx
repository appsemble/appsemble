# Actions

## Introduction

Actions are behaviors that define what happens when certain events within blocks or pages trigger.
Examples of such triggers are the `onLoad` action in the
[data-loader block](/blocks/@appsemble/data-loader) that gets called when the data-loader loads its
initial data, and the `onSubmit` action in the [form block](/blocks/@appsemble/form) that gets
triggered whenever the user presses the submit button.

The behavior of an action can be defined within the `actions` object in a block or page. An action
always requires the property `type`, which is what is used to determine which action should be used
whenever its associated trigger occurs.

Actions have specific implementations for each environment, i.e. `client` side and `server` side.
Client actions only work on pages and blocks in app. Server actions are used in Cron Jobs. An entire
list of server side actions can be found [here](/docs/03-guide/cron#actions). If an action is client
only then it’s defined as `noop` on the server.

Here’s an example of how you can use `onLoad` to trigger an action:

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: *version
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: resource.query
        resource: person
```

Here the `data-loader` block queries the `person` resource when the block is rendered.

Similarly, for onSubmit action:

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: *version
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        remapBefore: { null.strip }
        type: resource.create
        resource: person
        onSuccess:
          type: link
          to: Person List
        onError:
          type: link
          to: Error Page
```

Here when data is submitted via the `form` block, a `person` resource is created. If the resource is
created without an error, `onSuccess` action is fired and users are redirected to the Person List
page, whereas, in the case of an error, it redirects the users to an Error Page.

The `onSuccess` and `onError` properties can be used to define additional actions that should be
called depending on whether the action that was initially dispatched ran successfully or not as
illustrated above. This can be useful for triggering multiple actions in a row, such as calling the
`log` action before proceeding with a `link` action.

Actions will copy their data before being executed onto the `history` stack. This allows you to
retrieve this data in a later action by for example using `remapAfter` with the `history`,
`assign.history` or `omit.history` remappers. This is useful whenever an action overwrites data the
current data.

Below you can find the actions grouped by type that Appsemble supports.
