# Resources

## Introduction

Actions can be used to query the resources as well as perform various operations on resources.
Client side actions are extended from the `request` action, hence they support the fields supported
by the request action and additional fields as specified in every action’s description. To use
resources in your app, you need to define the resources in the `app-definition.yaml file`. Below is
an example of how you can define resources taken from the [Person](/apps/3) app.

```yaml validate resources-snippet
resources:
  person:
    schema:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
        - firstName
        - lastName
        - email
      properties:
        firstName:
          type: string
        lastName:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
        description:
          type: string
        picture:
          type: string
          format: binary
```

Supported resource actions are as below:

- [`resource.get`](#resourceget)
- [`resource.history.get`](#resourcehistoryget)
- [`resource.query`](#resourcequery)
- [`resource.count`](#resourcecount)
- [`resource.create`](#resourcecreate)
- [`resource.update`](#resourceupdate)
- [`resource.patch`](#resourcepatch)
- [`resource.delete`](#resourcedelete)
- [`resource.delete.all`](#resourcedeleteall)
- [`resource.delete.bulk`](#resourcedeletebulk)
- [`resource.subscription.subscribe`](#resourcesubscriptionsubscribe)
- [`resource.subscription.unsubscribe`](#resourcesubscriptionunsubscribe)
- [`resource.subscription.toggle`](#resourcesubscriptiontoggle)
- [`resource.subscription.status`](#resourcesubscriptionstatus)

### resource.get<Side name="resource.get" />

This action is used to fetch a single resource. Supported fields for this action are `type`,
`resource`, `id` and `view`. Fields `type` and `resource` are required. Resource refers to the
resource to be fetched, id can be specified explicitly using the parameter `id` or appsemble can
infer it from the data passed to the action function, explicitly defined id is preferred by the
system and view is the view to use for the resource. This action requires at least one of the app
permissions `$resource:all:get`, `$resource:all:own:get`, `$resource:all:get:<view-name>`,
`$resource:<resource-name>:get`, `$resource:<resource-name>:own:get` or
`$resource:<resource-name>:get:<view-name>` depending on the context. For more information check out
[security](../app/security.md#permissions). Here’s an example of how you can use this action to
fetch the `person` resource.
