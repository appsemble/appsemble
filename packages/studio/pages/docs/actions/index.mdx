# Actions

## Introduction

Actions are behaviors that define what happens when certain events within blocks or pages trigger.
Examples of such triggers are the `onLoad` action in the
[data-loader block](/blocks/@appsemble/data-loader) that gets called when the data-loader loads its
initial data, and the `onSubmit` action in the [form block](/blocks/@appsemble/form) that gets
triggered whenever the user presses the submit button.

The behavior of an action can be defined within the `actions` object in a block or page. An action
always requires the property `type`, which is what is used to determine which action should be used
whenever its associated trigger occurs.

All actions work on pages and blocks in an app by default (defined as `client`). Not all of them
work in [Cron Jobs](../guides/cron.mdx), however (defined as `server`). A full list of actions that
work on the `server` can be found [here](../guides/cron.mdx#actions). Alternatively, each action has
a tag that specifies whether they work on the `server` or not.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use `onLoad` to trigger an action:

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: 0.34.8
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: resource.query
        resource: person
```

Here the `data-loader` block queries the `person` resource when the block is rendered.

Similarly, for onSubmit action:

```yaml validate pages-snippet
pages:
  - name: Create Person
    blocks:
      - type: form
        version: 0.34.8
        actions:
          onSubmit:
            remapBefore: { null.strip }
            type: resource.create
            resource: person
            onSuccess:
              type: link
              to: Person List
            onError:
              type: link
              to: Error Page
  - name: Person List
    blocks:
      - type: markdown
        version: 0.34.8
        parameters:
          content: |
            ## Person list

            | Person   | Age |
            | -------- | --- |
            | Person 1 | 35  |
            | Person 2 | 52  |
            | Person 3 | 61  |
  - name: Error Page
    blocks:
      - type: markdown
        version: 0.34.8
        parameters:
          content: |
            Something went wrong creating this resource :/

            Please try again later
```

Here when data is submitted via the `form` block, a `person` resource is created. If the resource is
created without an error, `onSuccess` action is fired and users are redirected to the Person List
page, whereas, in the case of an error, it redirects the users to an Error Page.

The `onSuccess` and `onError` properties can be used to define additional actions that should be
called depending on whether the action that was initially dispatched ran successfully or not as
illustrated above. This can be useful for triggering multiple actions in a row, such as calling the
`log` action before proceeding with a `link` action.

Actions will copy their data before being executed onto the `history` stack. This allows you to
retrieve this data in a later action by for example using `remapAfter` with the `history`,
`assign.history` or `omit.history` remappers. This is useful whenever an action overwrites data the
current data.

## Base properties:

<ActionRef action={schemas.ActionDefinition.allOf[0]} excludeBase={false} />

Below you can find the actions grouped by type that Appsemble supports.

### Table of contents

<div>
  {importDocs().map((section) => (
    <li key={section.title.toLowerCase()}>
      <a href={`/docs/actions/${section.path.toLowerCase()}`}>{section.title}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</div>
