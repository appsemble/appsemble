### analytics<Side name="analytics" />

This action sends a Google Analytics event and returns the input data. Supported fields for this
action are `type`, `target` and `config`. Type is `analytics` in this case, target is the name of
the analytics target event to send and config is a remapper whose result will be sent to Google
Analytics as additional context. Below is an example of this action in use.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: 0.31.0
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: analytics
        target: page_view
        onSuccess:
          type: message
          body: { root }
```

### condition<Side name="condition" />

This action runs another action if a certain condition is met. Supported fields for this action are
`type`, `if`, `then` and `else`. If is a remapper to determine the condition to check. If this
yields a truthy value, the `then` action is called, otherwise the `else` action is called. Fields
`type` and `if` are required. Here is how you can use this action in your app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: radio
          name: triedAppsemble
          label: { translate: triedAppsemble }
          requirements: [required: true]
          options:
            - value: true
              label: { translate: yes }
            - value: false
              label: { translate: false }
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: condition
        if: { prop: triedAppsemble }
        then:
          type: message
          body: Welcome back
        else:
          type: message
          body: Welcome to Appsemble
```

### controller<Side name="controller" />

This action is used to specify a custom function from a JavaScript file to be used as the controller
to handle the action. This can help the user to overcome the limitations of `yaml` with logic
handling. Supported fields for this action are `type` and `handler`. Type is `controller` and
handler is the name of the function in the controller that will handle the action. Both of the
fields are required. Here is an example of this action being used in the
[controller](http://appsemble.app/apps/1030) app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: a
          type: number
          label: { translate: firstNumber }
        - name: b
          type: number
          label: { translate: secondNumber }
        - name: operation
          type: enum
          label: { translate: operation }
          enum:
            - value: addition
            - value: multiplication
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: controller
        handler: calculate
```

### download<Side name="download" />

This action is used to download data as a file. Supported fields for this action are `type` and
`filename`. Both fields are required, type is `download` in this case whereas `filename` is the
filename to save the file as. This must include a file extension. Here is an example of this action
being used.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: table
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - value: { prop: date }
          label: { translate: date }
        - value: { prop: name }
          label: { string.format: { messageId: name, values: { locale: EN } } }
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: download
        filename: holiday.ics
        remapBefore:
          ics:
            title: { prop: name }
            start: { prop: date }
            duration: 1d
            description: 'Test description'
```

### dialog<Side name="dialog" />

This action opens a pop-up dialog that can display blocks temporarily. Dialogs can be closed by
calling the `dialog.ok` or `dialog.error`. Users can still manually close dialogs, which should be
supported by the app. Blocks with the layout type `float` (e.g. `action-button`) do not work in this
action. Supported fields for this action are `type`, `title`, `closable`, `fullscreen` and `blocks`.
Title is an optional title to set in the dialog header, closable is a boolean representing whether
users are allowed to close the dialog by clicking outside of it or on the close button, fullscreen
denotes whether the dialog should be displayed full screen as if it’s a new page, or as a pop-up,
blocks is a list of blocks to display in the dialog. Fields `type` and `blocks` are required.
Following is an example of how to use this action.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: table
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - value: { prop: title }
          label: { translate: title }
    events:
      listen:
        data: refreshNotes
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: dialog
        title: { translate: editNote }
        closable: true
        blocks:
          - type: form
            version: 0.31.0
            parameters:
              fields:
                - type: string
                  name: title
                  label: { translate: title }
                  requirements:
                    - required: true
                - type: string
                  name: body
                  label: { translate: body }
                  multiline: true
            actions:
              onSubmit:
                type: resource.update
                resource: note
                onSuccess:
                  type: dialog.ok
        fullscreen: false
```

#### dialog.ok<Side name="dialog.ok" />

This action closes an open dialog. Type for this action is `dialog.ok`. Here is an example of this
action in use.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: title
          label: { translate: title }

    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: resource.update
        resource: note
        onSuccess:
          type: dialog.ok
```

#### dialog.error<Side name="dialog.error" />

This action also closes an open dialog but the dialog action that opened the dialog will be rejected
with the data passed to this action. Type for this action is `dialog.error`. Here is an example of
this action being used.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: title
          label: { translate: title }
          requirements:
            - required: true
        - type: string
          name: body
          label: { translate: body }
          multiline: true
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: resource.update
        resource: note
        onSuccess:
          type: dialog.ok
        onError:
          type: dialog.error
```

### each<Side name="each" />

This action is used to run an action for each entry in an array. The actions are run in parallel. If
the input is not an array, the action will be applied to the input instead. Supported fields for
this action are `type`, `serial` and `do`. Type is `each`, setting serial option runs the action in
series instead of parallel and do is the action to be called for each item in the input array. Below
is an example of this action in use.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      icon: trash
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: static
        value: [1, 2, 3]
        onSuccess:
          type: each
          do:
            type: message
            dismissable: true
            body:
              string.format:
                template: 'Message {num}'
                values:
                  num: { root }
          serial: true
```

### event<Side name="event" />

This action allows for other blocks to emit data upon triggering the action. This can be used to
make blocks interact with each other, such as triggering the `data-loader` block to refresh itself
by sending an event action that matches the name of what the block is listening to. This action
supports `type`, `event` and `waitFor` fields. Fields `type` and `event` are required to execute
this action. Event is the name of the event to emit. If waitFor field is specified, the action will
wait for this event to have been emitted and responds with its data. Here is how you can use this
action.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: button-list
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      buttons:
        - label: { translate: cancel }
          color: primary
          onClick: cancelDialog
        - label: { translate: configDelete }
          color: danger
          onClick: removeItem
    actions:
      cancelDialog:
        type: dialog.ok
      removeItem:
        type: resource.delete
        resource: note
        onSuccess:
          type: event
          event: refreshNotes
          onSuccess:
            type: dialog.ok
```

### email<Side name="email" />

The email action can be used to send emails via the Appsemble server. If `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` all
end up being empty, no emails will be sent but the action will still continue as normal. Supported
fields for this action are `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `from`, `subject`, `body` and `attachments`. Fields
`type`, `subject` and `body` are required. To is the address the email should be sent to, can be
either in the format of `test@example.com`, or `John Doe <test@example.com>`, From is the name of
the sender of the email. Cc is the list of email addresses to send a carbon copy to. Uses the same
format as `to`. Every email address in the CC is visible to all recipients, bcc is the list of email
addresses to send a blind carbon copy to. Uses the same format as `to`. Email addresses in the BCC
are hidden from other recipients, subject is the subject of the email, body is the body of the
email. The content of the body is converted to HTML using the Markdown syntax. Attachment are the
attachments to include in the email.

The remapper must resolve to an object containing the following properties:

- `target`: The asset ID or link to download contents from to add as an attachment. This is mutually
  exclusive with `content`.
- `content`: The raw content to include as the file content. This is mutually exclusive with
  `target`.
- `filename`: The filename to include the attachment as.
- `accept` If the target is a URL, this will be set as the HTTP `Accept` header when downloading the
  file.

If the attachment is a string, it will be treated as the target. Following is an example of email
action in use.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: string

        from: { prop: email }
        to: test@example.com
        body: { prop: body }
        subject: { prop: subject }
```

### log<Side name="log" />

This action is used to output the result of the action into the console, this is mostly useful for
debugging during app development. This action supports `type` and `level` fields. Only required
field is `type`. Level is the logging level on which to log and defaults to `info`. Available
options for level are `info`, `error` and `warn`. Below is an example of this action in use.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: string

        onError:
          type: log
          level: error
```

### match<Side name="match" />

This action runs another action if one of the cases is true, only the first case that equals true is
called. This action supports `type` and `match` fields. Both of the fields are required to use this
action. Match is array of objects, each object has two required properties, `case` and `action`.
Case is the case to be matched and action is the action to be executed when the case is thruthy. The
following is how you can use this action in your app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: enum
          name: testEnum
          label: { translate: testEnum }
          enum:
            - value: test
              label: { translate: test1 }
            - value: test2
              label: { translate: test2 }
          defaultValue: test
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: match
        match:
          - case: { equals: [prop: testEnum, test] }
            action:
              type: log
              level: info
          - case: { equals: [prop: testEnum, test2] }
            action:
              type: log
              level: warn
```

### message<Side name="message" />

This action is used to display a message to the user, this is useful in combination with action
chaining to notify users they have performed a certain action. This action supports `type`, `body`,
`color`, `layout`, `dismissable` and `timeout`. Body is a remapper representing the body of the
message, color represents the Bulma color to apply to the message and its value can be either of
`dark`, `primary`, `link`, `success`, `info`, `warning` or `danger`, layout is the position of the
message on the screen, its value can be either of `top` or `bottom`. Dismissable is a boolean value
indicating whether the user is able to dismiss the message manually and timeout is the time in
milliseconds how long the message should be visible. Fields `type` and `body` are required. Below is
an example of this action being used in an app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - type: date
          name: unformattedDate
          requirements:
            - required: true
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        remapBefore:
          object.from:
            formattedDate: [{ prop: unformattedDate }, { date.format: null }]
        type: message
        body:
          string.format:
            template: Formatted date = {date}
            values:
              date: { prop: formattedDate }
```

### noop<Side name="noop" />

This action is used to do nothing when this action is triggered, this is the default action for
block actions that are not required. The name of the action corresponds to no-operation. This action
returns the data passed to it. This action only supports a single field `type`. The following is an
example of this action in use.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: 0.31.0
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: resource.query
        resource: note
        onSuccess:
          type: noop
```

### notify<Side name="notify" />

This action is used to send notifications to one or all the users of an app. This action supports
`type`, `to`, `title` and `body` fields. All the fields are required to make this action work. Title
is a remapper that represents the title of the notification. Similarly, to is a remapper
representing to whom the notification should be sent. Use `all` to send the notification to all app
subscribed users. Or notify specific users by passing either a single user id or an array of user
ids. Nothing is sent if the value is **not** a valid user id. Body is a remapper containing the body
of the notifications. Below is how you can use this action in your app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: 0.31.0
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: resource.query
        resource: note
        onSuccess:
          type: notify
          title: { translate: resourceLoaded }
          to: [prop: $author]
          body: { translate: resourceLoadedNotifyBody }
```

### request<Side name="request" />

This action performs an HTTP request. This can be used to call the Appsemble API or an external API
in order to fetch data or send data. When sending `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `PATCH` calls the data
that is currently available in the block gets passed through. If the content type of the request is
`text/xml` or `application/xml`, the data will be converted to JSON. When the body of the request
action contains both files, and json, the content-type of `multipart/form-data` will be used
instead. When proxied the server will map strings with integers inside to the matching files by
index. In case you have a property defined with an integer as string value, this may be overwritten.
**This behavior is subject to change. In the near future we will likely make it use the `schema`
property to indicate the property is of format binary similar to resources. Therefore we do not
recommend using it as it may break in the near future.** This action supports `type`, `url`,
`method`, `query`, `body`, `proxy` and `schema` fields. Type and url fields are required to use this
action. Url is a remapper that results in the URL to send the request to, can be a relative URL
(E.g. `/api/health`) for usage with the Appsemble API, or an absolute URL (E.g.
`https://example.com`) for usage with external sites. Method is the type of request to make and can
be either of `delete`, `get`, `patch`, `post` or `put`. Default method is `get`. Query is a remapper
that results in either an object containing each property of the query string, or a string that gets
passed through as-is. Body is a remapper that results in the request body to send. Proxy is a
boolean, representing whether to proxy the requests through the Appsemble server. By default
requests will be proxied through the Appsemble API. This allows to protect user data and ensures
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is enabled. This behavior can be
disabled by setting this to `false`. If not specified, the raw input data is used.

`schema` is a JSON schema object that validates XML responses. **It does not validate regular JSON
responses, nor the request data. This behavior may be subject to change in the future**

Below is an example of this action being used to make a request.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: name
          label: { translate: name }
          type: string
          requirements: [required: true]
        - name: email
          type: string
          format: email
          label: { translate: email }
          requirements:
            - required: true
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: request
        url: https://test.example.com
        method: post
        body:
          object.from:
            name: { prop: name }
            email: { prop: email }
```

### share<Side name="share" />

This action can be used to display a prompt that allows the user to share something with others,
primarily via social media. Depending on whether the user’s browser supports a native share function
it will either display a native dialog for sharing links, or display a more limited fallback in a
dialog. This action supports `type`, `url`, `title` and `text` fields. Url is a remapper
representing the url that is being shared. Similarly, title is a remapper that represents The title
that should be shared and body is the main body that should be shared. Field `type` is the only
required field. The following is an example of this action in use.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      icon: share-nodes
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: share
        url: http://www.appsemble.app
        title: { translate: shareTitle }
        text: { translate: shareText }
    position: top left
```

### static<Side name="static" />

This action returns static data defined in the action definition, this is useful for example for
stubbing data. This action supports `type` and `value`. Both of the values are required to use this
action. Value is the static value to return. The following is an example of this action being used
in an app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: 0.31.0
    parameters:
      icon: share-nodes
    actions:
      onClick:
