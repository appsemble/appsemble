# App Member

## Introduction

App Member actions allow you to manage members for your app. Supported App Member actions are as
below.

- [`app.member.register`](#appmemberregister)
- [`app.member.invite`](#appmemberinvite)
- [`app.member.login`](#appmemberlogin)
- [`app.member.logout`](#appmemberlogout)
- [`app.member.query`](#appmemberquery)
- [`app.member.current.patch`](#appmembercurrentpatch)
- [`app.member.role.update`](#appmemberroleupdate)
- [`app.member.properties.patch`](#appmemberpropertiespatch)
- [`app.member.delete`](#appmemberdelete)

To use App Member actions, you must have a security definition in your app:

```yaml validate security-snippet
security:
  default:
    role: User
    policy: everyone
  roles:
    User: {}
```

### app.member.register<Side name="app.member.register" />

This action allows the user to register a new app member account using an email address and a
password and does nothing if the user is already logged in. Supported fields for this action are
`type`, `email`, `password`, `name`, `properties`, `login` and `picture`. Email and password are
used for logging in, `name` is the full name of the app member, `login` is a boolean value
representing whether to login the app member after registration (default value is true), picture is
the profile picture of the app member and properties is used to denote any custom properties
associated with the app member. All the values for properties are converted into strings. Here is an
example of this action in use. The created app member account will assume the default role defined
in the app's security definition or `Member` if a default role is not defined.
