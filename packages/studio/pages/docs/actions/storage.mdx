# Storage

## Introduction

Storage actions allow you to share data between blocks using the appStorage, sessionStorage,
localStorage or the indexedDB. `appStorage` is in memory and is the most secure among these storage
types but is cleaned after a page refresh. `sessionStorage` stores data for a session i.e. data is
stored until the tab (or browser) is closed. This is relatively less secure than the `appStorage`.
`localStorage` stores data for much longer times and data can only be manually cleared either using
javascript or by clearing the browser cache. `indexedDB` is way for you to persisently store data
inside user’s browser. This is the least secure among the storage types mentioned previously but a
great choice for storing data that is required for a longer time. To know more about the storage API
visit this [page](../guides/storage.md). Supported storage actions are as below:

- [`storage.read`](#storageread)
- [`storage.write`](#storagewrite)
- [`storage.append`](#storageappend)
- [`storage.subtract`](#storagesubtract)
- [`storage.update`](#storageupdate)
- [`storage.delete`](#storagedelete)

## Actions

### storage.read<Side name="storage.read" />

<ActionRef action={actions['storage.read']} />

Here’s an example of how you can use this action to read data with key poolData from sessionStorage.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: 0.32.2-test.7
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: storage.read
        storage: sessionStorage
        key: poolData
        onError:
          type: log
```

### storage.write<Side name="storage.write" />

<ActionRef action={actions['storage.write']} />

Here’s an example of how you can use this action to write data.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.32.2-test.7
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: name
          label: ''
          type: string
          requirements: [required: true]
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: storage.write
        key: name
        value: { prop: name }
        storage: localStorage
```

### storage.append<Side name="storage.append" />

<ActionRef action={actions['storage.append']} />

Here’s an example of how you can use this action to write data.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.32.2-test.7
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: fullName
          label: { translate: fullName }
          type: string
          requirements: [required: true]
        - name: birthDate
          label: { translate: birthDate }
          type: date
          requirements: [required: true]
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: storage.append
        key: people
        storage: appStorage
        value:
          object.from:
            birthDate: { prop: birthDate }
            fullName: { prop: fullName }
```

### storage.subtract<Side name="storage.subtract" />

<ActionRef action={actions['storage.subtract']} />

Here’s an example of how you can use this action to subtract an entry of data.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: 0.32.2-test.7
    parameters:
      icon: minus
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: storage.subtract
        key: people
        storage: appStorage
```

### storage.update<Side name="storage.update" />

<ActionRef action={actions['storage.update']} />

Here’s an example of how you can use this action to update the data in storage.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.32.2-test.7
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: fullName
          label: { translate: fullName }
          type: string
        - name: birthDate
          label: { translate: birthDate }
          type: date
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: storage.update
        key: people
        item: { prop: index }
        storage: appStorage
        value:
          object.from:
            birthDate: { prop: birthDate }
            fullName: { prop: fullName }
        onSuccess:
          type: log
```

### storage.delete<Side name="storage.delete" />

<ActionRef action={actions['storage.delete']} />

Here’s an example of how you can use this in action to delete the data in storage.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: 0.32.2-test.7
    parameters:
      icon: delete
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: storage.delete
        key: people
        storage: appStorage
```
