# Link

## Introduction

Link actions can be used to redirect users to other pages or absolute URLs. They are particularly
useful for navigation or redirecting. Supported link actions are the following.

- [`link`](../reference/action.mdx#link)
- [`link.back`](../reference/action.mdx#link.back)
- [`link.next`](../reference/action.mdx#link.next)

### link<Side name="link" />

This action is used to redirect the user to other pages or absolute URLs. Supported fields for this
action are `type` and `to`. To is the name of the page to link to. Sub-pages can be referred to
using arrays. If this matches with an absolute URL, link action will open this instead of matching
it with a page or sub-page. Both fields are required. Here is how you can use this action in your
app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: action-button
    version: 0.32.1-test.7
    parameters:
      icon: circle-chevron-right
    actions:
      onClick:
        type: link
        to: Page 2
```

### link.back<Side name="link.back" />

This action is used to link to the previous page in the browser history. Supported field for this
action is `type`, which is `link.back` in this case. The following is an example of this action
being used in an app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: control-buttons
    version: 0.32.1-test.7
    parameters:
      back: { icon: chevron-left }
      forward: false
    actions:
      onBack:
        type: link.back
```

### link.next<Side name="link.next" />

This action is used to link to the next page in the browser history. Supported field for this action
is `type`, which is `link.next` in this case. The following is an example of this action being used
in an app.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: control-buttons
    version: 0.32.1-test.7
    parameters:
      back: { icon: chevron-left }
      forward: { icon: chevron-right }
    actions:
      onBack:
        type: link.back
      onForward:
        type: link.next
```
