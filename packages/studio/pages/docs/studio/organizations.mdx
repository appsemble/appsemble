# Organizations

An organization represents a collective name for groups of apps, blocks and platform users. In order
to publish new blocks or to create and manage apps, the platform user needs to be in an
organization.

## Creating an organization

Organizations can be freely made in the Appsemble studio by visiting the settings page and clicking
on “Organizations” in the menu. From here you can view a list of organizations that you are already
part of, as well as create new organizations. When creating a new organization note that the
organization ID **must** be unique and cannot be changed after it has been created. This ID is used
to determine which blocks are used in an app, as well as where the app should be hosted by default.

## Deleting an organization

Organizations can be deleted by visiting the settings page of the respective organization and
clicking on the “Edit Organization” button. Only the owner of the organization is allowed to delete
the organization. In addition to that, the organization shouldn’t have any published blocks for it
to be deleted. Clicking on the `delete` button will open a popup for confirmation, following the
respective steps will allow you to delete the organization.

## Organization members

After creating an organization, members can be added via email. This email will contain a link that
the recipient can click on in order to accept or decline joining the organization.

Organization members can be assigned roles that affect which parts of the platform they have access
to. These roles are the following:

- `Member`: The default role for new organization members. Organization members are able to view
  private apps that belong to the organization.
- `AppTranslator`: App translators can view and modify app messages.
- `AppContentsExplorer`: App contents explorers can view app resources and assets.
- `AppContentsManager`: App contents managers can view and modify app resources and assets.
- `AppMemberManager`: App member managers can invite new members to an app and modify existing app
  members’ roles and properties.
- `AppGroupMembersManager`: App group members managers can invite exising app members to groups and
  modify existing group members’ roles.
- `AppGroupManager`: App group managers have all permissions of `AppGroupMembersManager`. They can
  also create new groups and modify exising ones.
- `AppManager`: App managers have the permissions of all of the above roles combined. They can also
  view and modify app variables, secrets and settings.
- `AppCollectionManager`: App collection managers can create and modify app collections.
- `BlockManager`: Block managers can publish and delete organization blocks.
- `Maintainer`: Maintainers can create and delete apps. They can also create and manage organization
  invites.
- `Owner`: Owners can update and delete organizations. They can also remove members and update their
  roles.
