# Account setup

In order to start using Appsemble, you must first create an account and organization.

Go to [register](/register)

![Appsemble Account Registration](assets/register-account.png 'Appsemble Account Registration')

Once you've submitted the registration you will get an email asking you to verify your email
address. You must verify your email address in order to be able to create an organization or app.

Once verified, go to [login](/login)

After you login you will get redirected to the app store. From here you can browse through existing
apps, access the documentation and of course create a new app.

If you want to create a new app, you will first need to be a part of an organization. You can either
get invited to an existing organization or create your own. In case you need to create your own, go
to the [organization page](/organizations) and click on **Create new organization**.

Once you're in an organization, you are free to start creating apps and using Appsemble to its
fullest potential!
