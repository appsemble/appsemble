# What is Appsemble?

Appsemble is a low-code platform that allows you to easily create an app without much technical
knowledge. Traditional software programs can get very complex and requires extensive IT experience
in order to be built properly. Appsemble lowers the bar of entry by handling all the complicated
backend infrastructure for you, leaving you to focus on the user experience.

An app is created by making an "App definition". This is a YAML-based definition that tells
Appsemble how your app is structured, what data you need to store, and much more. You can find more
information about this [here](/docs/guides/basic-app). Once the app is published, it becomes a
publicly available [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/articles/what-are-pwas).

Another big part of apps are blocks. Blocks are reusable components that you can put anywhere in
your app in order to create functional parts that determine how your app works. For example, a form
block that allows user to fill in information which the app can store.

The Appsemble framework is an open source software project. What this means is that the
infrastructure that handles how your app works in the backend is publicly available. Anyone can see
the code, make changes to it or create their own version of it entirely. If you're interested, you
can check it out here: https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble.

Appsemble can be a difficult piece of software to understand right away. We recommend you first
learn the basics by reading our documentation before diving into creating an app.

By going through the following docs, we're confident that you will understand the basics of
Appsemble:

- [Studio documentation](/docs/studio)
- [Basic app](/docs/guides/basic-app)
