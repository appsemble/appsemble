# Team

## Introduction

Team actions allow users with sufficient permissions to manage teams and invite members. To know
more about the teams visit [this page](../guides/teams.md). Team actions are client side actions,
i.e. these actions are not implemented for the server side. Supported team actions are as follow.

- [`team.invite`](#teaminvite)
- [`team.join`](#teamjoin)
- [`team.list`](#teamlist)
- [`team.members`](#teammembers)

### team.invite<Side name="team.invite" />

This action allows a user with sufficient permissions to invite users to a team. Supported fields
for this action are `type`, `id`, `email`, and `role`. Id is the id of the team to which the user
will be invited, email is the email of the user to be invited to join the team and role is the role
for which the user is being invited. Default value for role is member. Type is the only required
value for using this action. Here is an example of how you can use this action.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.29.7
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: email
          label: { translate: email }
          type: string
          format: email
          requirements: [required: true]
        - name: id
          type: hidden
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: team.invite
        onSuccess:
          type: log
```

### team.join<Side name="team.join" />

This action allows a user to join a team. Supported field for this action is `type`, which is
`team.join` in this case. It returns an error if the user tries to join a team that they are already
a member of, or if the team security is defined as `invite`. Here is an example of how you can use
this action to allow users to join a team selected by them.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.29.7
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: team
          label: { translate: team }
          requirements: [required: true]
          type: enum
          enum:
            - value: team1
            - value: team2
    actions:
      onSubmit:
        type: team.join
        remapBefore: { prop: team }
        onSuccess:
          type: log
```

### team.list<Side name="team.list" />

This action allows to get a list of all of the teams in an app. Supported field for this action is
`type`, which is `team.list` in this case. An example use case of this action is providing users of
your app the option to choose the team they want to join. Here is an example of previously mentioned
use case of the action.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: form
    version: 0.29.7
    parameters:
      fields:
        - name: team
          label: { translate: selectTeam }
          type: enum
          action: getTeams
    actions:
      getTeams:
        type: team.list
        remapAfter:
          - array.map:
              object.from:
                label:
                  prop: name
                value:
                  prop: id
```

### team.members<Side name="team.members" />

This action gets a list of a teamâ€™s members. Supported fields for this action are `type` and `id`.
Id is the ID of a specific team to get the members from and the type is `team.members`. This can be
particularly helpful in keeping a record of roles assigned to various users. Both the fields are
required. Here is an example of this action being used to fetch all the employees of a particular
department in a company.

```yaml validate blocks-snippet
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: 0.29.7
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: team.members
        id: { prop: department }
        onSuccess:
          type: log
```
