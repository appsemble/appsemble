## Changing Indentation

Select the code: use TAB to indent to the right and use SHIFT + TAB to indent to the left

## Saving the file

To refresh the preview you can press `CTRL + S` or on a mac `CMD + S`. To actually save the changes
you can click the `Publish` button.

## Comment

When you want to add a comment or extra information that is not part of the code you can add a `#`
in front of that line.

You could also toggle the remark symbol to complete code blocks by selecting all the lines you want
to remark and then press `CTRL + /` or on a mac `CMD + /`

## Code suggestions

While coding your application you can press `CTRL + SPACE` to show suggestions on how to complete
the code. This can be incredibly handy when you have to choose an item from a list, like an action.
