## Introduction

App webhooks are a mechanism that allows external parties to call app endpoints with custom
functionality, defined in the form of Appsemble [actions](../reference/action.mdx). Webhook
endpoints will be automatically generated based on the webhooks definition in the app definition.
Webhooks can be called by making a `POST` request (intentionally, only `POST` requests are supported)
to `{apiUrl}/apps/${appId}/webhooks/${webhookName}`.

Webhooks can define a schema for the payload they expect to receive. The payload will be validated
on the server. Either `multipart/form-data` or `application/json` payload can be used.

In order to be able to use the webhook, you need to generate a webhook secret for it in the studio.
After generating a webhook secret, review its value in the studio and copy it. You must provide it
in an `Authorization` header in your `POST` request prefixed by `Bearer `. Each webhook secret is
tied to a specific webhook. Providing its value in the header gives the caller permissions for all
the actions in the webhook.

## Actions

Similar to [cron jobs](./cron.mdx), webhooks can contain only certain actions that we support on the
server, they may still be used in older apps, but will run a `noop` action instead. The actions also
work a little different e.g. the actions are not run by the user, so retrieving user information
with the[user](../remappers/data.mdx#user) remapper wonâ€™t work the same.

> Note: In contrast to cron jobs, webhooks support file uploads, and in extension - assets.

Supported (server-side) actions:

<ul>
  {Array.from(serverActions).map((action) => (
    <li key={action}>
      <a href={`/docs/reference/action#${action}`}>{action}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

## Example

In the following example we define a webhook for creating `record` resources, which also supports
file uploads. By specifying `type: string`, `format: binary` for the `pdf` and `xml` fields in the
webhook schema, we can enable server side file parsing.

```yaml copy
webhooks:
  createRecord:
    schema:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
        - foo
      properties:
        foo:
          type: string
        pdf:
          type: string
          format: binary
        xml:
          type: string
          format: binary
    action:
      type: resource.create
      resource: record
```
