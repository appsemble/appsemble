# Cron Jobs

Appsemble provides a way to run [actions](../reference/action.mdx) based on a schedule through cron
jobs.

They are especially useful for reoccurring actions like e.g. sending emails to notify your users
about upcoming events.

## Schedule

The format for the schedule is based on the `cron` format, to see this in action head over to
[Crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/).

> **Note**: Cron job schedules are checked every `5` minutes. This means that if you schedule a job
> to run at `14:01` it will instead run at `14:05`. Keep this in mind when scheduling your jobs to
> make sure they don't run later than you intended.

**Cron format**

```
*    *    *    *    *    *
┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
│    │    │    │    │    |
│    │    │    │    │    └ day of week  (0 - 7) (both 0 and 7 will have it run on Sunday)
│    │    │    │    └───── month        (1 - 12)
│    │    │    └────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│    │    └─────────────── hour         (0 - 23)
│    └──────────────────── minute       (0 - 59)
└───────────────────────── second       (0 - 59, optional)
```

_Extra options:_

- **(day of week)`L`**: the last occurrence of the specified week day for the month in progress.
- **(day of month)`L`**: last day of the month.

Cron jobs are defined at the top level of the app definition with the
[cron](../reference/app.mdx#-app-definition-cron) property.

```yaml copy validate cron-snippet
cron:
  everyDayAt10:
    schedule: '* 10 * * *' # Quotes are required if the first character starts with `*`
    action:
      type: resource.query
      resource: person
```

## Actions

Cron jobs can be specified with only certain actions that we support on the server, they may still
be used in older apps, but will run a `noop` action instead. The actions also work a little
different e.g. the actions are not run by the user, so retrieving user information with the
[user](../remappers/data.mdx#user) remapper won’t work the same.

> **Note**: We do not recommend using resource actions with resources that have properties in binary
> format, as assets are currently unsupported.

Supported (server-side) actions:

<ul>
  {Array.from(serverActions).map((action) => (
    <li key={action}>
      <a href={`/docs/reference/action#${action}`}>{action}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

## Security

Cron jobs that contain request action and need [service secrets](../guides/services.md) to be
applied for the outgoing request need the cron field to be defined with permissions being an empty
array in the [security definition](../app/security.mdx#security-definition) of the app.

```yaml security definition cron
security:
  cron:
    permissions: []
```

## Logs

In a deployed instance of Appsemble, cronjobs are run in a seperate Kubernetes pod. Logs for the job
will be found in that pod, not in the main Appsemble pod. To debug the cronjob, we recommend running
the action in a part of the app that's easier to reproduce.
