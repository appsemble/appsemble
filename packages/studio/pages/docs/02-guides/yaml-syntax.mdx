# YAML syntax

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a human-readable data serialization language. Within
Appsemble, YAML is used as language to write an app definition in, for example.

YAML supports different types of syntax. The following piece of code:

```yaml
condition: { equals: [1, 1] }
```

can also be written as:

```yaml
condition:
  equals:
    - 1
    - 1
```

## Best Practices

There are several scenarios where one syntax format is better than the other. For example, if you
have a very big statement, you shouldn’t write everything on one line as it hinders code
readability. Similarly, in smaller statements, unnecessary indentations will decrease readability
and add complexity.

Here’s a good example of that. The following code

```yaml
name: John Doe
job: Developer
foods:
  - Apple
  - Mango
  - Strawberry
  - Lentils
  - Meat
skills:
  - Python
  - Linux
  - Go
  - Javascript
  - Docker
```

can be written better as

```yaml
name: John Doe
job: Developer
foods: ['Apple', 'Mango', 'Strawberry', 'Lentils', 'Meat']
skills: ['Python', 'Linux', 'Go', 'Javascript', 'Docker']
```

## Examples

Remappers can often be used in many different ways.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```yaml
remapAfter:
  - root: null
  - root:
  - { root: null }
  - { root: }
  - { root }
```

<Collapsible title="See playground" collapsed className="is-6">
  <Playground
    customOption={{
      input: { remapper: 'syntax' },
      remapper: `# Key/value pairs
- root: null
- root:
- { root: null }
- { root: }
- { root }
# Lists (containing key/value pairs)
- [root: null]
- [root: ]
- [{ root: null }]
- [{ root: }]
- [{ root }]`,
    }}
  />
</Collapsible>
