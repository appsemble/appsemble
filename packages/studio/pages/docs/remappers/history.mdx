# History

## Introduction

The “history” concept is an important part of remapping advanced pieces of data within Appsemble.

Whenever you create an action, the data that is passed to that action is saved in the history stack.
This data can then be accessed again using the various `history` remappers.

The following example shows what a history stack would look like in an action. Every resulting data
from between two actions, including the first action, is assigned to that point in the history
stack:

![history stack](../../../../../config/assets/remapper-tutorial/history-stack.jpg 'History stack visualisation')

Keep in mind that the value passed to the action can be influenced by changing the data beforehand
using `remapBefore` or `remapAfter`.

For example, if you have the following code:

```yaml
type: resource.query
resource: people
remapAfter:
  object.from:
    name: Disrupting
    type: data!
onSuccess:
  type: log
```

The result of the final log will be:

```json
{
  "name": "Disrupting",
  "type": "data!"
}
```

The reason for this is because `remapAfter` changed the resulting value of the `resource.query`
action and instead the object gets passed to the log action. The result of the resource query is not
relevant anymore.

Now, if you want to get the resulting (remapped) data back from the first action, you can count the
index of the action (in this case 1) that the data got passed along to and use it with the `history`
remapper to retrieve it from the stack.

```yaml
type: resource.query
resource: people
remapAfter:
  object.from:
    name: Disrupting
    type: data!
onSuccess:
  type: resource.query
          ...
                  remapBefore:
                    history: 1
                  type: log
```

Still returns the old object, no matter how many actions have appeared in between:

```json
{
  "name": "Disrupting",
  "type": "data!"
}
```
