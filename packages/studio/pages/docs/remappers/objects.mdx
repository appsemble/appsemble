# Objects

## Introduction

Object remappers are very versatile in their functionality. You can easily create or update objects
in whatever way you want to. There are object remappers available to add or remove properties from
an existing object, or you can even create your own object. When creating a complex app with lots of
big data streams being sent around, this can get really useful, as you get full control of what the
data looks like. If you get an object with lots of properties, but you only need a few, you can just
omit the ones you don’t need. Alternatively, you can just create a new object with just the ones you
need.

In the [Remapper tutorial](../remappers/), we referred to the Spotify song data that contains a ton
of properties with different types of data like `acoustincness`, `danceability`, and more. There, we
filtered the data by only referencing certain properties in the table block. This still means the
data is there, however. If you want to store this data somewhere, it still contains the full list of
properties.

To solve this, you can directly alter the object itself to only contain the data you want it to
have. One way to do this, similar to the table example in the tutorial, is to create a new object
with only the properties you want it to have and then use that for any future functionalities.

For example, here is the data received when querying the ‘Audio Features’ endpoint for a Spotify
track:

```json
{
  "acousticness": 0.346,
  "analysis_url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/2GfQhXyoUXYTkMHDXJhCU5",
  "danceability": 0.565,
  "duration_ms": 544518,
  "energy": 0.906,
  "id": "2GfQhXyoUXYTkMHDXJhCU5",
  "instrumentalness": 0.00474,
  "key": 9,
  "liveness": 0.0718,
  "loudness": -5.229,
  "mode": 0,
  "speechiness": 0.124,
  "tempo": 119.856,
  "time_signature": 4,
  "track_href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2GfQhXyoUXYTkMHDXJhCU5",
  "type": "audio_features",
  "uri": "spotify:track:2GfQhXyoUXYTkMHDXJhCU5",
  "valence": 0.38
}
```

If you want to store this data but don’t need all the data, like the Spotify-specific references,
you can create an object using just the properties you want.

With the following remapper definition, you create an object that only stores the `danceability`,
`liveness`, `tempo`, and `time_signature`:

```yaml
object.from:
  danceability: { prop: danceability }
  liveness: { prop: liveness }
  tempo: { prop: tempo }
  time-signature: { prop: time_signature }
```

If you want to add some additional information, you can use the `history` remapper in combination
with these remappers to create an even more extensive object. With this, you create your own object
using the different data sources from Spotify. Additionally, you can create a nested object by
specifying the `object.from` remapper within a property. By combining this, you can create an object
containing the song’s audio features and track info to then store in a resource.

This is what the remapper definition would look like (where `history: 1` is the object we created
before):

```yaml
# Call Spotify track’s API endpoint
object.from:
  audio_features: { history: 1 }
  track_info:
    object.from:
      name: { prop: name }
      popularity: { prop: popularity }
      spotify_url: [{ prop: external_urls }, { prop: spotify }]
```

If you did this right, you should get an object like this:

```json
{
  "audio_features": {
    "danceability": 0.565,
    "liveness": 0.0718,
    "tempo": 119.856,
    "time_signature": 4
  },
  "track_info": {
    "name": "Iron Lung",
    "popularity": 54,
    "spotify_url": "https://open.spotify.com/track/2GfQhXyoUXYTkMHDXJhCU5"
  }
},
```

You could do this for every song you want, allowing you to create your own playlist for your app
containing only the data you want.
