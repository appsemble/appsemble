# Conditions

## Introduction

Conditions are most commonly used to filter data within an application. There are lots of uses for
filtering, either by cleaning up your data so it only contains what you need or by only showing data
that contains certain data.

At the base of conditions in Appsemble, you have the [if](#if) or [match](#match) statement. These
statements are built as follows:

- `condition`: Compares whether the input value is valid. This can either be a condition like
  [equals](#equals) or just checking if the input value is not null.
- `then`: The remapper to fire whenever the `condition` is considered <span
  style={{ color: 'green' }}>true</span>.
- `else`: The remapper to fire whenever the `condition` is considered <span
  style={{ color: 'red' }}>false</span>.

In action, this looks like this:

```yaml
if:
  condition:
    equals:
      - prop: number
      - 4
  then:
    static: You guessed right!
  else:
    static: You guessed wrong!
```

Every conditional statement within Appsemble is a variation of this. For example, in the condition
you can replace the `equals` with [gt](#gt), [lt](#lt) or [not](#not). Additionally, the `if` can
also be replaced with [match](#match) to compare a value against multiple conditions at the same
time without nesting a ton of if-statements inside each other.
