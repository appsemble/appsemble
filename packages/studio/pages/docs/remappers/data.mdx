# Data

## Introduction

There are lots of points to get data from in Appsemble. We can divide it into a few sections:

- Global data ([app](#app), [step](#step), [page](#page), [translate](#translate), [user](#user))

These are accessible from everywhere and always contain the same data wherever it’s called from. For
example, the `app` remapper contains information about the app, the `user` remapper contains
information about the user, and the `translate` remapper allows you to access the app’s
translations.

- Remapper data ([array](#array), [history](#history), [prop](#prop), [root](#root))

These only have data from within that remapper’s context. `array` only returns data from within the
array it’s in, `history` contains the history of the entire remapper, etc.

- Dynamic data ([context](#context), [static](#static))

These are more dynamic depending on where the remapper is called. `context`, for example, will only
return something if it’s within the action of a block and that block sends something to the context.

It takes knowing all these types of data remappers to fully take advantage of your application and
its surrounding data and ecosystem. You can more easily integrate your application with the
surrounding Appsemble systems using the “Global data” remappers by adding translations or using a
user’s locale to change what they see, for example.
