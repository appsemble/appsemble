# Remappers

## Introduction

Remapper functions are objects that define how a value should be transformed. This can be useful for
various purposes, such as retrieving properties from data structures, transforming data and
formatting text.

A remapper is structured as follows. A remapper function gets data from a source. This can be an
action, an event, etc. Then, the function can define a remapper or an array, or remappers to
manipulate this data.

When using an array of remappers, it executes each one after the other from top to bottom. This way
you can create a whole stack of remappers to completely transform a set of data into something else.

As an example, say we have a big dataset of users but we only want to show specific properties of
each user.

Given the following data:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Patrick",
  "lastName": "Stuart"
}
```

The user that’s passed to this remap function is an object with two string properties: “firstName”
and “lastName”. What if we want to only show the first name of this user? For this we can use the
`prop` remapper. This remapper allows you to target a specific property of the data passed to the
function.

This means that with the data above, we can easily get the first name using this `prop` remapper:

```yaml
prop: firstName
```

Result:

```json
"Patrick"
```

We have now successfully remapped existing data! Instead of a big user dataset, it now only shows
their first name.

If we want to further manipulate this data, it’s best to do in the same remap function as well.
Because the function can contain an array of remappers, we can easily alter the data further. In the
`YAML` language, you can define an array in a multitude of ways. To keep your code clean, it’s best
to define it with a `-` before each item.

With this in mind we can remap this data even further by defining the function as an array with
multiple remappers. Now, we use the `prop` and `string.case` remappers to transform the data even
further:

```yaml
- prop: firstName
- string.case: upper
```

Result:

```json
"PATRICK"
```

Now that you know the basics of remappers we can get into some real app writing.

### How does this work in an app?

Let’s say you want to create an app that displays a list of songs in a table. You might not know
this, but services like Spotify store a lot of data you don’t directly see in their database.
According to the developer documentation a track contains 18 audio features. Some of these features
are `acousticness`, `danceability`, `loudness` and `duration_ms`. When you want to show a user their
playlist of songs, you only want to show relevant information like the song’s title, artist and
duration. We can use remappers to filter this data further to only show this information.

See the following page definition

```yaml
name: Playlist
blocks:
  - type: data-loader
    version: 0.34.12
    actions:
      onLoad:
        type: resource.query
        resource: songs
    events:
      emit:
        data: songData
```

In here we define a `data-loader` block. In this block we call the `resource.query` action when the
page is loaded. This action retrieves the entire dataset that is stored in the `songs` resource:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "string",
    "artist": "string",
    "duration": "string",
    "release-date": "date",
    "metadata": "string",
    ...
  }
]
```

If we want to only show certain properties, we can directly use the `prop` remapper to only show
what we want. The `table` block accepts a remapper as the value under a column. We can use this to
insert the specific properties of a song we want.

```yaml
- type: table
  version: 0.34.12
  parameters:
    fields:
      - label: Title
        value: { prop: title }
      - label: Artist
        value: { prop: artist }
      - label: Duration
        value: { prop: duration }
  events:
    listen:
      data: songData
```

With this in mind, you should be able to understand what is going on in the default
[Person app](https://appsemble.app/en/apps/3). This covers some of the very basics of remappers.
Next, there will be a bit more of an advanced example.

### Advanced remapping

As the final part of this tutorial we will go over a bit more advanced filtering of data. We will
take the example of a big dataset of users again.

```yaml
type: data-loader
version: 0.34.12
actions:
  onLoad:
    type: resource.query
    resource: people
    remapAfter:
      - array.map:
          if:
            condition:
              equals:
                - prop: city
                - 'Eindhoven'
            then:
              object.omit:
                - city
            else: null
      - null.strip: null
events:
  emit:
    data: peopleInEindhoven
```

This looks like a lot, but after going through every bit it should start to make some sense.

The `data-loader` here gets every person in the `people` resource. After that, it creates a remapper
function containing two remappers:

1. `array.map`: This remapper goes through every item in the data that is given (if the data is an
   array) and applies the remappers in the function on it. So, within this remapper every person in
   the resource is individually given to the remappers inside. In this case, they are compared to an
   `if` remapper. This `if` remapper has a condition which compares the property `city` within the
   user and checks if it is equal to “Eindhoven”. If this is true, it removes the `city` property
   from the person’s properties. If this is false, it sets the person object to null.

   When this remapper is done, an array that is filled with people that had the value of “Eindhoven”
   under the `city` property is outputted. People that didn’t are set to null.

   > **Note:** Remappers don’t directly alter the resource itself. It only changes data within the
   > **context** of the remapper itself.

2. `null.strip`: This remapper removes any `null` value from the data that is given to it.
   Considering the output of the previous remapper was an array mixed with people and null values.
   This cleans up the data, so that you _only_ have actual people in the dataset.

The end result of this is a fully filtered list of users from the city of Eindhoven. Next, you could
display this information in any block you’d like to use via the event emitter from the data-loader
block.

### Conclusion

You should be familiar with the very basics of remapping now. A lot more remappers exist in the
framework and more will be added over time, so it’s good to get familiar with the most important
ones. Keep experimenting with them and you will find out just how powerful remappers are.
