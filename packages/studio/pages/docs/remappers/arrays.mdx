# Arrays

## Introduction

In the [Objects](../remappers/objects.mdx) page, we explained how to manipulate an object so it only
contains specific properties/data. This only applies to a singular object however. Usually, you will
be working with lists of objects that have to be manipulated.

If you have a list of employees, for example, you can use the `array.map` remapper to map over the
list and apply remappers to the incoming data. That way, you can make sure that every employee in
the list is checked for a condition, gets assigned new data, etc.

Let’s say you have a list of employees from your company, and you want to remove the `age` property
from every individual employee. Instead of manually picking each individual from the list and
applying the `object.omit` remapper, you can simply map through the list and apply the remapper
there.

For example, with the following employee data:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Peter",
    "occupation": "Photographer",
    "age": 19
  },
  {
    "name": "Otto",
    "occupation": "Scientist",
    "age": 50
  },
  {
    "name": "Harry",
    "occupation": "CEO",
    "age": 20
  }
]
```

You only have to map through the array and omit the `age` property like so:

```yaml
array.map:
  object.omit:
    - age
```

You can also use this to assign a new property to the object based on an
[if condition](./conditionals.mdx#if). With this data, you could check if the employee’s age is
above a certain amount and give them the title of “Senior” instead of the age, for example:

```yaml
array.map:
  - if:
      condition: { gt: [{ prop: age }, 40] }
      then:
        object.assign:
          title: Senior employee
      else:
        object.assign:
          title: Junior employee
  - object.omit:
      - age
```

Now you transformed your existing array into one that fits your app’s business case better. But,
this only holds three people. What if you want to add a new employee? Or remove an existing one?
There are more remappers available for cases like this: [array.append](#array.append) and
[array.omit](#array.omit).

This is also just one group, but what if your company has more groups? You can create a new array
using [array.from](#array.from) and add the group you just made, along with other groups. For
example, the following remapper definition will take the previously made array and creates a new one
inside of another array.

```yaml
array.from:
  - { root: null }
  - array.from:
      - object.from:
          name: Peter 2
          occupation: Delivery driver
      - object.from:
          name: Harry 2
          occupation: CEO
```

Result:

```json
[
  [
    {
      "name": "Peter",
      "occupation": "Delivery driver",
      "title": "Junior employee"
    },
    {
      "name": "Otto",
      "occupation": "Scientist",
      "title": "Senior employee"
    },
    {
      "name": "Harry",
      "occupation": "CEO",
      "title": "Junior employee"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "name": "Peter 2",
      "occupation": "Delivery driver"
    },
    {
      "name": "Harry 2",
      "occupation": "CEO"
    }
  ]
]
```

Once you have an array filled with the properties and data you need for your application you can
save it in a resource, send it in an email, etc.
