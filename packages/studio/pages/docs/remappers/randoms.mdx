# Randomness

## Introduction

If you want to introduce a ‘chance’ or ‘random’ element into your application, you can use one of
the various `random` remappers.

These remappers can be used in a number of scenarios, like generating a random password or choosing
a random name from a list. If you want to build a casino application, these should come in very
handy.
