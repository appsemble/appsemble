# Date

## Introduction

Dates can be very tricky in coding. Within Appsemble there are serveral remappers that help simplify
this process. For example, if you have a [Form](/blocks/@appsemble/form) block that contains a
`date-picker` field, you might want to change how itâ€™s formatted before storing it in a resource.
The incoming date from the form looks like this: `yyyy-MM-dd`, but you want it to be in the ISO 8601
string format. You can use [date.parse](#date.parse) to solve that problem and get it in the right
format. This can also be done the other way around using [date.format](#date.format).

On top of converting dates, you can also change them using [date.add](#date.add), or get the current
date with [date.now](#date.now).
