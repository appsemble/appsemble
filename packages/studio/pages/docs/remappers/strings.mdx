# String-manipulation

## Introduction

With remappers you can manipulate strings in a number of ways. This can be very helpful when you
want to display information in a certain way. For example, if you want to display a whole list of
users in uppercase you can simply use the `string.case` remapper.

Let’s say you have an application that fetches all the employee data from a company’s department.
This data is stored as an array of objects, each having a first name, last name, address, etc. You
want to present this data in a neat list where each employee’s first name is in uppercase and a bit
of text describes what the employee does.

This data would look something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "firstName": "Peter",
    "lastName": "Parker",
    "department": "Photography"
  },
  {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Jameson",
    "department": "Editor"
  }
]
```

If you were to use a [list block](/blocks/@appsemble/list), you can fill in the different fields
with this information. But just putting the data straight in can be a bit limiting, as you can only
really apply the format of ‘`label`: `value`’.

The header of the list item is what informs the reader what the item is about. In this case, this
would be the user’s first name, as each card is about that specific user. To make this stand out and
make it look more like a header, you can make the name all upper case, for example:

```yaml
header: [{ prop: firstName }, { string.case: upper }]
```

> **Note:** You can specify a remapper as an array to chain remappers together

If you want to add more information to this card, like a description, you can also use the
`string.format` remapper to combine incoming data and a string template into a dynamic result.

Because the list block’s fields accept remappers as input, we can add this to the block’s
definition. This looks like this:

```yaml
label: Description
value:
  string.format:
    template: '{firstName} {lastName} is an employee of the {department} department!'
    values:
      firstName: { prop: firstName }
      lastName: { prop: lastName }
      department: { prop: department }
```

The list block’s definition now has plenty of the incoming data integrated and formatted to be more
visible and descriptive. This is, of course, only a small example. You can expand this much more by
applying other remappers. For example, you could add a condition that sets a different icon based on
the employee’s department to reflect their position.

The full result of this block definition can be seen here:

![List of employees](../../../../../config/assets/remapper-tutorial/employee-list-example.png 'List of employees')

The complete block definition looks like this:

```yaml
type: list
version: 0.36.2-test.3
events:
  listen:
    data: dailyBugleEmployees
parameters:
  header: [{ prop: firstName }, { string.case: upper }]
  fields:
    - label: Description
      value:
        string.format:
          template: '{firstName} {lastName} is an employee of the {department} department!'
          values:
            firstName: { prop: firstName }
            lastName: { prop: lastName }
            department: { prop: department }
```
