# A guide to app long description

In Appsemble, apps can have a long description, visible in the app page in the Appsemble studio.

To provide a long description for an app, define a `README.md` file in the app directory. This file
will be automatically processed when publishing or updating the app.

## Long description by language

An appâ€™s long description can be translated by creating more `README` files in the format
`README.<language>.md`. These files will be automatically processed when using the
`appsemble app publish` and `appsemble app update` commands.
