## Introduction

By default apps are styled using the [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io/). This includes
elements like the default colors and text font. As an app developer, you can change these default
styling options or add your own custom CSS to make your app look just the way you'd like.

The options provided are:

- [**Theming**](../guides/theming): Setting basic colors
- [**Custom CSS**](../guides/custom-css): Specific component styling
