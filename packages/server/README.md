## Installation

The Appsemble server is distributed as a Docker image.

To pull the latest version, run

```sh
docker pull appsemble/appsemble
```

Also a Docker image is built for each release.

```sh
docker pull appsemble/appsemble:$VERSION
```

## Variables

The Appsemble Docker image can be configured using environment variables. Each variable can also be
passed as a command line parameter instead, if desired.

## Setting up Social Login

In order to use social logins using third parties such as Google or GitLab, an _application key_ and
an _application secret_ must be provided. Follow instructions below to enable login using these
services.

When using social login, the `HOST` variable is required. This should be the full host on which the
Appsemble server is available.

### GitHub

Go to your [GitHub OAuth2 Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) under _Developer settings_.

Add the following Authorization callback URL, where `HOST` is the actual value `HOST` variable.

```
{HOST}/callback
```

**Example**: `https://example.com/callback`.

Click _Register application_.

### GitLab

Go to your [GitLab profile applications page](https://gitlab.com/profile/applications).

Add the following redirect URL, where `HOST` is the actual value `HOST` variable.

```
{HOST}/callback
```

**Example**: `https://example.com/callback`.

Check the `read_user` scope, and click _Save application_.

### Google

Go to the
[Google Cloud console OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)
Add the scopes `email` and `profile`. Under **_Authorized domains_**, add the `HOST` variable. Fill
in any missing information and click _Save_.

Now go to the
[Google Cloud console credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Click
_Create credentials_ → _OAuth client ID_ → _Web application_. Add the `HOST` variable under
**_Authorized JavaScript origins_**. Under **_Authorized redirect URIs_**, add the following URI.

```
{HOST}/callback
```

**Example**: `https://example.com/callback`.

Check the `read_user` scope, and click _Save application_.

### SMTP

To be able to send emails from your local environment, you need to set up or connect to an SMTP
server.

A project that provides an email testing environment for developers is
[Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit). It acts as an SMTP server where you can view and test
captured emails.

For connecting to the SMTP server, you need to obtain the following settings:

- Host
- Port
- Username
- Password

#### Server configuration

In the project’s root `package.json` you can define the following properties under
`"appsembleServer"`:

```json
"smtp-host": "(SMTP Server)",
"smtp-port": "(SMTP Port)",
"smtp-user": "(SMTP Username)",
"smtp-pass": "(SMTP Password)",
"smtp-from": "(Standard email address to put as sender)"
```

These can also be used as CLI parameters.
