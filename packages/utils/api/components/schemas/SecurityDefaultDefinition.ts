The following values are allowed:
- \`everyone\`: Every authenticated user gets the default role.
- \`organization\`: Every authenticated user gets the default role if they are in the same organization as the app.
- \`invite\`: The user has to manually get a role assigned.

> **Important**: When [OAuth2](../02-guides/oauth2) or [SAML2.0](../02-guides/saml) is used in the
> app, you must set the policy to \`everyone\`. This will specifically allow every configured
> authentication method on the secrets page to be used as login method. If you do not want other
> Appsemble user accounts to be able to log in, you must \`disable\` the \`appsemble login\` options
> (including the Appsemble OAuth2 option) in the secrets page. If this option is enabled, any
> Appsemble user account is able to log in to the app and will receive the default role.
