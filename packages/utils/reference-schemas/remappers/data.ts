understand what the context of a certain block does, check the block’s description.

For this example, we will take the [\`table\`](/blocks/@appsemble/table/0.20.39) block. As of now,
this block provides two options for context: \`index\` and \`repeatedIndex\`. Whenever you click on an
item in the table, it gives the index of that table row in the associated action.

So with the following example:

\`\`\`yaml
type: table
version: 0.20.39
events:
  listen:
    data: contextData
parameters:
  fields:
    - label: Name
      value: { prop: name }
      onClick: clickName
    - label: Age
      value: { prop: age }
actions:
  clickName:
    remapBefore:
      context: index
    type: log
\`\`\`

Clicking on the first item would log \`0\`, the second item \`1\` and so on.

  history: {
    type: 'integer',
    description: `> **Note:** This remapper is explained more in depth in the [History](/docs/remapper/history) page

Gives the data at the history entry at the specified history index. The history at specified index
is the data that is passed to that action.

\`\`\`yaml
remapBefore:
  object.from:
    title: Most influential bands of all time
    content: ...

    onSuccess:
      remapBefore:

Result:

While in a loop page, this remapper allows you to get properties from the data at the current index.

      parameters:
        fields:
          - label: { step: title }
\`\`\`

With this example, we load an array of questions that have the \`title\` property. What the \`step\`
remapper does in this case is show the title of the current question in the loop.

The result of this is a flow page where each page shows the question’s title.

`,

  page: {
    enum: ['data', 'url'],
    description: `Gives actual information about the current page. This remapper gives access to the following
information:

- \`data\`: Current page data (FlowPage)
- \`url\`: Full URL of the current page

Example:

\`\`\`json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Peter"
  },
  "url": "https://example-app.examplecompany.appsemble.app/en/example-page-a"
}
\`\`\`

The page data only works in the context of a flow page. Let’s say you have a
[“FlowPage”](/docs/reference/app#-flow-page-definition) type with multiple subpages. Whenever you
navigate to the next page it adds the data from that page to the flow page’s data. The page remapper
allows you to access this cumulative data.

The following page definition shows a page definition for a flow page where the user has to fill in
some user information. For each subpage the result of \`page: data\` is shown.


\`\`\`yaml
name: PageDataFlow
type: flow
steps:
  # page: data = {}
  - blocks:
      - type: form

          fields:
            - name: name
              type: string
        actions:
          onSubmit:
            type: flow.next
  # page: data = { name: "Peter" }
  - blocks:
      - type: form
        version: 0.20.39
        parameters:
          fields:
            - name: age
              type: string
        actions:
          onSubmit:
            type: flow.next
  # page: data = { name: "Peter", age: "47" }
  - blocks:

            remapBefore:
              page: data
            type: log

The result of the final page’s log would then be:

This remapper allows you to easily add translations to your app. To make this remapper work, replace
any static text with \`translate: {name}\`. Then, in your app’s Translations page pick the language
you want to translate. You will see a list of names with input text below. Translations you manually
put in the app using the \`translate\` remapper are found under “Custom messages”.

After putting the translation in, any user that logs in with that language selected will see the
translated message.
