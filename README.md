## Usage

These are instructions for developing the Appsemble core platform. Production setup instructions can
be found in [here](packages/studio/pages/docs/deployment/helm.md).

### Live Environments

Our production environment is available on [appsemble.app](https://appsemble.app).

Our staging environment is available on
[staging.appsemble.review](https://staging.appsemble.review). This environment hosts the latest
changes in the `staging` branch. This environment is reset every night at 04:00 AM UTC. The point of
this environment is to mimic production as closely as possible. It is the last stage where changes
are added to before they reach production.

For each of our internal merge requests a review environment is started at
`${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID}.appsemble.review`.

### Requirements

**Minimum Hardware Requirements**

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| CPU      | 1 GHz   | >2 GHz      |
| CPUs     | 1       | 2>          |
| RAM      | 12GB    | 16GB>       |
| Disk     | 3 GiB   | >           |

**Software Requirements**

In order to run the Appsemble project in development mode on Linux, macOS or Windows, the following
must be installed.

- [Docker][]
- [Docker Compose][]
- [NodeJS 20.18][nodejs]

### Getting started

Clone and setup the project.

> Note: your CLI should have elevated privileges when setting up and starting the app

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble.git
cd appsemble
npm ci
```

We use playwright to create the mermaid diagram, you can install it with

```sh
npx playwright install
```

The project requires a PostgreSQL database. This project contains a Docker Compose configuration to
spin up a preconfigured database with ease.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

The project can be served using the following command.

```sh
npm start
```

To see additional options, run the following command.

```sh
npm start -- --help
```

#### CLI Login

A new account can be registered by going to `http://localhost:9999/register`. Later you can login on
`http://localhost:9999/login`. You can use any email address as long as it satisfies the email
format of `user@email-provider.ext`. As the email is sent from the localhost environment, it is
actually not received by the user instead the email containing the verification link will be printed
in the server logs. You need to click this link in order to verify you email and use your account.
If you connect your localhost environment to an SMTP server, this email will be sent normally and
you will receive the verification link. Similarly, if you login using `GitHub`, `Gitlab` or
`Google`, you will be authenticated from your account.

To login using the Appsemble CLI, run the following command.

```sh
npm run appsemble -- login
```

> Note: when using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), this command is **unsupported**. The
> workaround for this is manually creating OAuth2 credentials at
> `http://localhost:9999/settings/client-credentials` and passing them to the CLI by setting the
> `APPSEMBLE_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
> [More details](https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble/-/issues/958#note_1299145503).

This will open Appsemble studio in a new window in your browser. A panel will pop up where you must
select the permissions you need. You will need to select at least _blocks:write_,
_organizations:write_ and _apps:write_ to complete the steps below. Clicking confirm creates an
OAuth2 access token, which is required in order to publish blocks and apps. Click register and your
OAuth2 client credentials will be shown. This will be required when you proceed with the publishing
blocks and apps steps below.

#### Registering an Organization

To get started developing locally, an Appsemble organization identified through id: `appsemble`
needs to be created. This organization can be created either in Appsemble Studio, or using the
following CLI command.

```sh
npm run appsemble -- organization create --name Appsemble appsemble
```

#### Publishing Blocks

After logging in to the CLI, Appsemble blocks can be published locally by running the following
command.

```sh
npm run appsemble -- block publish blocks/*
```

If prompted, select the OAuth2 credential you created earlier to proceed. You will now see the
published blocks in the `Block store` page.

Any block that is found within the workspaces listed in `package.json` will be hot-reloaded. More
information about block development and hot-reloading can be found
[here](https://appsemble.app/docs/development/developing-blocks).

#### Publishing App templates

In order for users to create apps from within the Appsemble Studio, existing apps that can be used
as a starting point must be marked as templates. This can be done using the Appsemble CLI, after
logging in. To publish these apps, run the following command.

```sh
npm run appsemble -- app publish --context development apps/*
```

The published apps will be displayed on the `App store` page.

### Development Server

The development server can be started by running:

```sh
npm run appsemble -- serve <path-to-app-directory>
```

See the [CLI readme](packages/cli/README.md#development-server)

### Tests

Tests can be run using the following command.

```sh
npm test
```

The tests are ran using vitest, meaning all [vitest CLI options][] can be passed.

By default, database tests are run against the database as specified in
[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). The database can be overridden by setting the
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Note that this should **not** include the database name.
Multiple test databases are created at runtime.

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:password@localhost:5432 npm test
```

### Building

The Appsemble Docker image can be configured using environment variables. Each variable can also be
passed as a command line parameter instead, if desired. This includes adding variables for
connecting to an SMTP server.

The full explanation of setting up your local server, including a full list of environment
variables, can be found at [packages/server/README.md](packages/server/README.md).

The resulting Docker image can be built using the Docker CLI.

```sh
docker build --tag appsemble .
```
